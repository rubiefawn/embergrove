# The 1661 Silver Passage Mine Incident

In the spring of 1661, HESCO began mining in Silver Passage, a small cave system eighty miles south-west from Connie Fief. On 1661-07-16 at 10:30, a general distress radio signal was sent out, stating there was a fire and a hostile entity, the latter of which had been temporarily restrained. Rather than follow usual fire protocol, HESCO ordered an immediate full evacuation of all personnel. All persons were accounted for except the operations director, the head engineer, the assistant head engineer, a professor from the [[College of Circles]] who was conducting research, and two DBHC agents who were present on-site for a routine safety inspection. Thirty hours later on 1661-07-18 at 16:33, the [[angel]] Sahaquiel passed over the Silver Passage installation (a divergence from its predicted path by over 320 miles) and glassed the installation and the cave system both.

Several months later, the professor was found at home in good health, likewise was one of the DBHC agents. The former belatedly filed a report, which was immediately classified; the latter denied ever receiving an assignment to the Silver Passage installation and insisted she was not present for the incident.
