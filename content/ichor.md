Ichor is the raw form of [[petroleum]], and is magically volatile and extremely unsafe. It warps reality around it in unpleasant ways, and is a common vector of the Curse. It is visually identical to oil, except it luminesces an unsettling crimson glow when disturbed. It is practically useless due to how dangerous it is, but it upon ichor that the [[fey]] feed.
