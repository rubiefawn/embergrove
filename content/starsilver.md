Starsilver, or "vorpum" in scholarly circles, is a silvery metal often found in meteorites. It gently glows a white light under direct moonlight and shares some of the [[Moon|moon's]] anti-magic properties. It is the only thing other than the [[Curse]] capable of destroying the Cursed, though this merely redirects the Curse onto something nearby.
