The Curse is a supernatural phenomenon. It is not well understood. Here is what is known:
- The Curse can afflict a person, a creature, an object, or a place. These things are the Cursed.
- The Curse is permanent and can never be removed. The only cure for the Cursed is annihilation.
- The Cursed can only be destroyed by something else Cursed, or by [[Starsilver|starsilver]]. Doing so does not destroy the Curse, which passes on to a nearby person, creature, object, or place.
- The Curse manifests its affliction in different ways, warping reality around the Cursed in terrifying and unpredictable violations of natural law. This warping may be temporary or permanent.
- While the Curse manifests in several unique ways, the way in which it manifests in any particular Cursed thing is always the same.
- A person can harness the power of the Cursed and attempt to control these warping effects. This is a type of magic. It is extremely dangerous.
- The Curse and its manifestations may warp the mind or body, but magic derived from it cannot. Attempting to do so backfires with varying degrees of severity.
- The [[Fey]] are entirely immune to becoming Cursed, and cannot use magic. However, the fey are not immune to the warping powers of the Curse, nor are they immune to magic.
- [[Ichor]] often imparts the Curse.
